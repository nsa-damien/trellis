# Release v0.7.0

**Release Date:** 2026-01-16

## Highlights

This release transforms `/trellis.implement` into a fully autonomous execution engine. Tasks now run continuously without per-task prompts, with intelligent agent routing and maximized parallelism for faster implementations.

## What's New

### Continuous Execution
- Processes all beads without stopping for user confirmation between tasks
- Only pauses for genuine blockers that require intervention
- Fresh agent context per bead ensures isolated, focused execution

### Intelligent Agent Routing
Tasks are automatically routed to specialized agents based on file patterns and keywords:
- `.tsx/.jsx/.vue/.svelte` files → frontend-developer
- API/endpoint/service tasks → backend-architect
- migration/schema/model tasks → database-architect
- `.py` files → python-pro
- `.go` files → golang-pro
- `.ts` files → typescript-pro

### Maximized Parallel Execution
- Uses single-message multi-Task pattern for concurrent agent launches
- Multiple unblocked tasks execute simultaneously when safe
- Significant speedup for implementations with independent tasks

### Graceful Blocker Handling
Actionable blocker messages with categorized codes:
- BC-001: Missing dependencies
- BC-002: Circular dependencies
- BC-003: External blockers
- BC-004: Resource conflicts
- BC-005: Validation failures

### Enhanced Completion Report
- Agent utilization statistics
- Parallel batch execution metrics
- Continuous execution stats

## Bug Fixes

No bug fixes in this release.

## Breaking Changes

None. This release is fully backward compatible.

## Upgrade Instructions

No special upgrade steps required. Simply update to the latest version:

```bash
claude plugin update github:NorthShoreAutomation/trellis
```

The enhanced `/trellis.implement` behavior activates automatically.
