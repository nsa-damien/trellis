# Release v0.1.1

**Release Date:** 2025-12-28

## Highlights

This patch release improves the install script by using symlinks instead of file copies, making it easier to receive updates without re-running the installer.

## What's Changed

- **Install script uses symlinks**: Command files are now symlinked rather than copied during installation. This means any updates to the source Trellis commands are immediately available without needing to reinstall.

## Upgrade Instructions

Re-run the install script to switch from copied files to symlinks:

```bash
./install.sh
```

Or for project-level installation:

```bash
./install.sh --project
```
