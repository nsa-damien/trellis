# Release v0.7.2

**Release Date:** 2026-01-18

## Highlights

This release improves code maintainability by eliminating duplicate test plan generation logic in `/trellis.implement`. The command now delegates to `/trellis.test-plan` for consistent behavior.

## What's Changed

- `/trellis.implement` now invokes `/trellis.test-plan` via Skill tool instead of having inline test plan generation instructions
- Removed 15 lines of duplicate test plan logic from step 13
- Test plan generation behavior remains identical - only the implementation changed

## Bug Fixes

None in this release.

## Breaking Changes

None. This is a pure refactoring with no user-facing changes.

## Upgrade Instructions

No action required. Simply update to the latest version.
