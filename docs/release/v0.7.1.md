# Release v0.7.1

**Release Date:** 2026-01-17

## Highlights

This patch release adds automatic commit-and-push after each completed bead in `/trellis.implement`, providing real-time visibility into implementation progress. It also enhances `/trellis.test-plan` with improved configuration loading and documentation generation.

## What's Changed

### `/trellis.implement` Auto-Commit
- Each successful task is immediately committed with message: `feat: complete [BEADS_ID] - [bead title]`
- Changes are pushed to remote after each commit
- New `--no-commit` flag to disable auto-commit behavior when needed

### `/trellis.test-plan` Enhancements
- **Configuration loading**: Prioritizes app defaults → project root `.env` → OS env vars
- **New `.env.example`**: Generated in `tests/` folder documenting all required environment variables
- **New `USAGE.md`**: Generated in `tests/` folder with run instructions, prerequisites, and troubleshooting
- **Improved log format**: Clear request/response separation with timestamps and duration
- **Language-specific patterns**: Added Python (`requests`/`httpx`) and TypeScript (`axios`) logging patterns
- **New `--skip-test-plan` flag**: Skip generating test-plan.md if it already exists

## Upgrade Instructions

No breaking changes. Simply update to the latest version:

```bash
claude plugin update github:NorthShoreAutomation/trellis
```

To disable auto-commit behavior in `/trellis.implement`, use the `--no-commit` flag.
