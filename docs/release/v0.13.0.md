# Release v0.13.0

## Context Handoff Skill

New `/trellis:context-handoff` skill for seamless session continuity.

### What it does

Generates a structured `handoff.md` document that captures everything a fresh Claude Code session needs to resume work without re-explanation. The skill gathers objective git state and synthesizes conversation context into a document covering:

- **Goal** — what we're trying to accomplish
- **Status** — completed, in-progress, and remaining work
- **Key files** — what's being modified and why
- **Decisions** — choices made and their rationale
- **Dead ends** — approaches tried and abandoned (prevents re-exploration)
- **Discoveries** — non-obvious findings that would take time to rediscover
- **Resume instructions** — concrete first steps for the next session

### When to use

- Session approaching context limits
- Pausing work to resume later
- Switching between sessions on the same task
- Say "handoff", "context handoff", or invoke `/trellis:context-handoff`

### Design philosophy

The skill is built around what an AI assistant actually needs for continuity — not just git diffs (which show *what* changed) but the *why* behind decisions, the dead ends that shouldn't be retried, and the mental model of how the system works as understood through the session's work.
