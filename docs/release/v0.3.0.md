# Release v0.3.0

**Release Date:** 2026-01-14

## Highlights

This release introduces the new `/trellis.test-plan` command for generating comprehensive test documentation, and significantly improves `/trellis.implement` with parallel agent orchestration for 3-5x faster implementation speeds.

## What's New

### `/trellis.test-plan` Command
Generate manual test files and test plan documentation for feature specifications:
- Creates runnable test file (`FEATURE_DIR/tests/manual.{ext}`) with HTTP logging transport
- Generates `FEATURE_DIR/test-plan.md` with verification checklists and testing scenarios
- Supports Go, Python, TypeScript, and JavaScript
- Includes sensitive data masking for shareable logs

### Parallel Agent Orchestration
`/trellis.implement` now launches multiple specialized agents simultaneously:
- Routes tasks to domain experts: frontend-developer, backend-architect, database-architect, python-pro, typescript-pro, golang-pro
- Hybrid conflict detection predicts file overlaps and serializes conflicting tasks
- Configurable via `--parallel-limit N` (default: 3) and `--no-parallel` flags
- All implementation agents use Opus model for complex work

## Bug Fixes

- `/trellis.implement` now always generates test-plan.md by executing test plan generation BEFORE final completion validation
- Refactored `/trellis.implement` command file from 667 lines to 159 lines (76% reduction) while maintaining all functionality

## Breaking Changes

None.

## Upgrade Instructions

1. Pull the latest changes: `git pull`
2. Re-run the install script if using symlinks: `./install.sh`
