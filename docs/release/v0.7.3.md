# Trellis v0.7.3

**Release Date:** 2026-01-19

## Overview

This release adds support for plugin marketplace installation from private GitHub repositories, making it easier for team members to install Trellis without manual setup.

## What's New

### Marketplace Installation Support

Trellis can now be installed using Claude Code's plugin marketplace system:

```bash
# Add the repository as a marketplace source
/plugin marketplace add NorthShoreAutomation/trellis

# Install the plugin
/plugin install trellis@NorthShoreAutomation/trellis
```

### Private Repository Authentication

Since Trellis is a private repository, comprehensive documentation has been added for setting up GitHub authentication:

1. **Personal Access Token creation** - Step-by-step guide with direct links to GitHub settings
2. **Environment variable setup** - Shell profile configuration examples for bash/zsh
3. **Alternative configuration** - Settings file approach via `~/.claude/settings.json`

## Changes

### Added
- `marketplace.json` for plugin marketplace installation
- GITHUB_TOKEN setup instructions in README

### Changed
- Installation instructions updated to use marketplace-based workflow
- Replaced simple install command with full authentication guide

## Upgrade Notes

No breaking changes. Existing installations via `--plugin-dir` continue to work.

For new installations, follow the updated README instructions to configure your GitHub token before installing.
