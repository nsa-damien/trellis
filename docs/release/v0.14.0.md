# Release v0.14.0

## Context Resume Skill

New `/trellis:context-resume` skill — the read-side companion to `/trellis:context-handoff`.

### Session continuity lifecycle

```
End of session:   /trellis:context-handoff  →  writes handoff.md
Start of session: /trellis:context-resume   →  reads handoff.md + validates
```

### What it does

Reads a `handoff.md` document and validates that the current git state matches what the handoff captured. Presents a compact orientation and flags any drift before you start working.

**Git state validation:**
- Branch mismatch detection ("handoff says `feat/X` but you're on `main`")
- New commits since handoff — shows what changed
- Uncommitted changes drift — flags if expected in-progress changes are missing or unexpected changes appeared

**Orientation summary:**
- Goal, completed work, in-progress items, remaining tasks
- Count of documented decisions, dead ends, and discoveries
- Concrete first action from the handoff's Resume Instructions

**Staleness warning** when the handoff document is >48 hours old.

### Also in this release

- `/trellis:context-handoff` now tells you to use `/trellis:context-resume` instead of manually reading `handoff.md`
