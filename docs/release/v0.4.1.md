# Release v0.4.1

**Release Date:** 2026-01-14

## Highlights

This patch release improves the newly added `/trellis.push` and `/trellis.release` commands based on code review feedback. Commands now follow project conventions and handle edge cases more gracefully.

## What's New

No new features in this release.

## Bug Fixes

- **Frontmatter convention**: Both commands now use `description` instead of `version` in YAML frontmatter, matching other trellis commands
- **Beads availability check**: Commands now check for `.beads/` directory and `bd` command before attempting beads operations, preventing errors in projects without beads
- **Prerelease detection**: Simplified and clarified instructions for detecting pre-release versions in `/trellis.release`
- **Error recovery docs**: Fixed step number references in the error recovery section to match actual workflow steps
- **Commit message format**: Simplified commit message instructions in `/trellis.push` to be more concise

## Breaking Changes

None.

## Upgrade Instructions

No action required. Simply update to the latest version to get the improved commands.
