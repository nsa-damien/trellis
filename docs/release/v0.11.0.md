# Release v0.11.0

**Release Date:** 2026-02-16

## Highlights

Codemap is now the recommended starting point for new projects, replacing the removed init skill. The implement engine reads CODEMAP.yaml for faster navigation and auto-updates it after each implementation session.

## What's New

- **Codemap integration in implement** — `/trellis:implement` now reads `CODEMAP.yaml` at the start of analysis (step 2) to accelerate codebase navigation, and auto-updates it non-interactively after all work units complete (new step 7)
- **Codemap as onboarding entry point** — Quick Start and documentation now recommend `/trellis:codemap` as the first thing to run in a new project

## Removals

- **`/trellis:init` removed** — The init skill detected project type, checked beads, and printed a summary, but produced no durable artifacts. Everything it did, Claude already does naturally when you start working. Codemap is the meaningful onboarding step.

## Bug Fixes

- **Skill autocomplete** — Removed non-standard frontmatter keys (`disable-model-invocation`, `user-invocable`) that prevented skills from appearing in Claude Code's `/` autocomplete menu

## Upgrade Instructions

No breaking changes. If you have scripts or documentation referencing `/trellis:init`, replace with `/trellis:codemap`. All other commands work unchanged.
