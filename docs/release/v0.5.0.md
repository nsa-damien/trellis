# Release v0.5.0

**Release Date:** 2026-01-14

## Highlights

Trellis is now a native Claude Code plugin. Installation is simplified to a single command, and the license has changed to proprietary for North Shore Automation internal use.

## What's New

- **Native Plugin Support**: Install Trellis with `claude plugin install github:NorthShoreAutomation/trellis`
- **Plugin Manifest**: Added `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` for Claude Code discovery
- **CLAUDE.md**: Added guidance file for Claude Code when working in this repository
- **Development Workflow**: Contributors can load locally via `claude --plugin-dir /path/to/trellis`

## Breaking Changes

### License Change
The license has changed from MIT to **Proprietary**. Use is now restricted to North Shore Automation employees and authorized contractors only.

### Installation Method
The symlink-based `install.sh` installer has been removed. All users must migrate to the plugin-based installation.

## Upgrade Instructions

If upgrading from a previous version:

1. **Install via plugin:**
   ```bash
   claude plugin install github:NorthShoreAutomation/trellis
   ```

2. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   /trellis.status
   ```
