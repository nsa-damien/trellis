# Release v0.1.0

**Release Date:** 2025-12-28

## Highlights

Trellis bridges [spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) task planning with [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) LLM-aware issue tracking. This enables dependency-driven task execution, session recovery, and progress queries for Claude Code workflows.

## What's New

### Commands

- **`/trellis.import`** - Import `tasks.md` into beads issue tracker
  - Creates epic hierarchy (feature → phases → tasks)
  - Establishes dependencies from sequential task structure
  - Applies labels (US1, US2, parallel, test, etc.)
  - Generates `beads-mapping.json` for sync

- **`/trellis.implement`** - Execute with dependency-aware ordering
  - Uses `bd ready` to determine executable tasks
  - Tracks status via beads database
  - Syncs completions back to tasks.md checkboxes
  - Supports `--continue` for session recovery

- **`/trellis.sync`** - Bidirectional sync between beads and tasks.md
  - Detects discrepancies and conflicts
  - Auto-resolves or prompts for resolution
  - Supports `--force-beads` and `--force-tasks` modes

- **`/trellis.ready`** - Quick check of unblocked work
  - Queries beads for tasks with no blocking dependencies
  - Displays ready work with priorities

- **`/trellis.status`** - Project health overview
  - Shows progress (open/in-progress/closed)
  - Lists blocked and ready work
  - Runs health checks

### Documentation

- Comprehensive README with workflow diagrams
- Architecture documentation explaining the integration model
- AGENTS.md snippet for automatic beads integration
- Example beads-mapping.json showing the schema
