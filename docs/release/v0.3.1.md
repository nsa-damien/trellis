# Release v0.3.1

**Release Date:** 2026-01-14

## Highlights

The `/trellis.test-plan` command is now more flexible - it works with or without beads integration. Projects that don't use beads for task tracking can now use the test plan generator directly from spec files.

## What's Changed

- **Optional beads integration**: The `/trellis.test-plan` command no longer requires `beads-mapping.json` to exist
- If beads integration is not found, the command proceeds with spec-based test generation instead of stopping
- When beads is available, it continues to use the full beads integration with progress tracking

## Upgrade Instructions

No breaking changes. Simply update to the latest version:

```bash
# If installed via symlinks
git pull origin main

# Or re-run the install script
./install.sh
```
