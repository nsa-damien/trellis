# Release v0.2.0

**Release Date:** 2026-01-12

## Highlights

This release introduces the `/trellis.epics` command for breaking down PRDs into LLM-executable implementation phases, adds the `/trellis.prd` command for interactive PRD development, and enhances `/trellis.implement` with automatic test plan generation after implementation completion.

## What's New

### `/trellis.epics` Command
Break down a PRD into sequenced, LLM-executable epics. Each epic is a self-contained phase of work that:
- Can be implemented in isolation
- Produces working, testable functionality
- Contains enough context for an LLM to execute without prior session history
- Integrates with Beads for dependency tracking

### `/trellis.prd` Command
Interactive PRD development workflow through structured discovery. Creates comprehensive Product Requirements Documents focused on functional requirements and user experience.

### Test Plan Generation
`/trellis.implement` now automatically generates a comprehensive `test-plan.md` after implementation:
- Test environment setup (prerequisites, setup steps, test accounts)
- Manual verification checklist organized by phase and user story
- Feature testing scenarios with step-by-step instructions
- Customized for your tech stack (API curl examples, DevTools checks, CLI examples)

## Breaking Changes
