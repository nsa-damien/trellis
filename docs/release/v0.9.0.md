# Release v0.9.0

**Release Date:** 2026-02-16

## Highlights

Trellis commands have been migrated from the legacy `commands/` directory to a skills-based architecture under `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`. All 8 subagents now include comprehensive system prompts with domain-specific rules, tool constraints, and quality guidelines for more effective task routing and execution.

## What's New

- **Skills architecture**: All trellis commands are now Claude Code skills, enabling cleaner invocation and better integration with the plugin system
- **Simplified skill names**: Cleaner naming convention (e.g., `/trellis:push`, `/trellis:pr`, `/trellis:release`)
- **Expanded knowledge skills**: Architecture and style reference skills provide agents with project context
- **Comprehensive agent definitions**: All 8 agents (code-reviewer, database-architect, frontend-developer, general-purpose, golang-pro, python-pro, test-runner, typescript-pro) expanded with detailed system prompts (~2000 lines added)

## Removed

- Legacy `commands/` directory — all functionality preserved in skills

## Upgrade Instructions

No action needed. The plugin will automatically use the new skills layout. All `/trellis:*` commands continue to work as before.
