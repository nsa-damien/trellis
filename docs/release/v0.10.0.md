# Release v0.10.0

**Release Date:** 2026-02-16

## Highlights

Trellis is now an AI-native development workflow plugin with a two-command lifecycle: `/trellis:scope` to do the work, `/trellis:release` to ship it. All spec-kit dependencies have been removed, beads is now optional, and the license has changed from Proprietary to MIT.

## What's New

- **`/trellis:scope`** — The primary entry point for all new work. Describe what you want in natural language, confirm the approach once, and scope handles everything: branch creation, implementation, commits, push, and PR creation.
- **`/trellis:init`** — First-time project setup. Detects your project type, test framework, linter, and CI configuration. Checks beads availability and presents trellis conventions.
- **`--approved` flag** — Scope now signals implement to skip its proposal step, eliminating double-confirmation.

## Breaking Changes

- **Workflow redesign**: The plugin now follows a two-command lifecycle (`scope` + `release`) instead of the previous multi-command workflow.
- **Skills removed**: `prd`, `epics`, `import`, `sync`, `test-plan`, `ready` have been removed. Their functionality is either absorbed into remaining skills or no longer needed.
- **Spec-kit removed**: All `.specify/` infrastructure and `.claude/commands/speckit.*.md` files have been deleted. Trellis no longer depends on or references spec-kit.
- **License change**: Changed from Proprietary to MIT.

## Other Changes

- `/trellis:implement` rewritten as an autonomous plan-build-verify engine with self-correction loops (max 3 retries per work unit)
- `/trellis:status` now includes ready work display (absorbed from the removed `ready` skill)
- Beads downgraded to soft dependency — all skills gracefully skip beads when not installed
- Architecture and style knowledge skills rewritten for AI-native identity
- Agent terminology decoupled from beads (all agents use generic "task" language)
- Backend-architect agent expanded to match peer agent depth
- Consistent frontmatter across all skills

## Upgrade Instructions

1. Update your plugin: `claude plugin update trellis`
2. If you used `/trellis:prd`, `/trellis:epics`, or other removed commands, switch to `/trellis:scope` which handles the full workflow
3. Beads integration continues to work if installed — no changes needed
4. Run `/trellis:init` in existing projects to verify your setup
